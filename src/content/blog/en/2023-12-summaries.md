ðŸ§µ 1/9 - Monthly summary #12, December 2023

Hi there, I'm trying a new format for this monthly thread :)

December had a looooot of stuff!

Starting with Manufactur'inc, I released 2 DevBlog.
The first one was about a big feature I've been working on since early November: Logistics.

ðŸ§µ 2/9

Logistics rework is meant to make resource transfer and creation more realistic, and it works pretty well!

The second DevBlog was a bit shorter and themed with the date: How real-life events will impact the gameplay.

ðŸ§µ 3/9

Still on the #gamedev theme, I did a lot of rework on each of my games' Steam pages: description, keywords, tags, GIFs, and even some screenshots were replaced.
It feels a lot better now!

ðŸ§µ 4/9

Last but not least game dev milestone, Extortion has been translated to Simplified Chinese!
I had an amazing community contribution from a player and I spent some time reworking the translation system to make it more "natural", but it's worth it!

ðŸ§µ 5/9

I needed to change my mind about this long and difficult Logistics rework, so I tried and did a particle simulation using the same technologies as my games.
(And yes, I was inspired by that popular video on the web!).

ðŸ§µ 6/9

In some other development fields, my Discord server stat bot got a privacy update, we now stop saving message content (which was useless) and only save message length for stats purposes: https://github.com/Elanis/discord-server-stats/releases/tag/1.1.0

ðŸ§µ 7/9

Another pretty good milestone of mine was my first project to reach 1000 stars on Github!
I never expected it to grow, not even that big, but I'm happy it helps people (and now Github asks me to name a successor ... ðŸ˜‚)

ðŸ§µ 8/9

I also did a lot of other things including a .NET 8 upgrade of my projects, and some Grafana improvements on my personal assistant, ...
You can scroll my Github ( https://github.com/Elanis/ ), follow me, or join the Discord ( https://discord.gg/c8aARey ) to see all of this and the future ones!

ðŸ§µ 9/9

Oh and to conclude what happens when you fail your algorithm and spam Steam API?
Your IP gets temp ban ... ðŸ˜…
