Hello there !

Today will be a short monthly thread.
To startup with June, let's start with the end of the month (why not ?!).

I participated in a gamejam late June and tried to create an incremental game.
11 hours of work, very limited, but here it is: https://elanis.itch.io/cosmic-idle

Something else I liked working on (and actually started during May) is a website analyzer.
I've been having fun creating a small tool looking for some weird headers, HTML Tags, CVE and so on. I have plenty of ideas!
This tool isn't public yet, but I hope to make it public soon :)

And finally, I also tried some generative art (not with a lot of success) by trying to implement perlin noise myself.
Not a big deal, but I was happy of that evening.

Finally, I did a lot of additional stuff including:
- Working on some Rust compat with new things in Steam dll/.so, PR is available here: https://github.com/Noxime/steamworks-rs/pull/132
- Closing 99/102 dependabot PRs

And here we are for June !
