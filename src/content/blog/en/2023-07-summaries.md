Hello there !

Tweetdeck isn't paid only (yet) so I'm still posting on twitter this month.

What happened during July ? Well, that was a busy month !

I published 2 QOL updates on alchemistry last month:

- https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1730540/view/3672171270364709586 

<hr />

I also worked on my personal assistant to make it more accessible for non-dev (still some work to do tho):
- I created an UI to download modules easily (see picture)
- Fixed server version auto-restart on crashing
- Updated UI to Electron 25 (it's only consuming 55MB of RAM !)

I continued my work on automating my infrastructure by adding automatic DNS deployment to my infrastructure repo (https://github.com/Elanis/Infras/tree/main/production/octodns).
Also, I did migrate the last bits (old Git server and mail server) from my previous server so I can add it to my new and shiny k3s cluster.

As some of you might have seen, I'm preparing to announce my next game publicly. Expect this announce before the end of the month (if everythings goes fine ðŸ¤ž): https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Elanis/110815835754579783

As a preparation for this game and standardization of lots of things around my existing games, I also published the press-kits in a more visible way on Dysnomia website: https://dysnomia.studio

As of random other stuff:
- I finally merged my big pull request on the Electron & alternatives comparison benchmark: https://github.com/Elanis/web-to-desktop-framework-comparison/pull/352, still lots of work to do, but I'm happy it's finally merged !
- I closed 189/191 Dependabot PR this month (there were a lot of them :o)

<hr />

I am also preparing for Gamescom (August 23rd -> 25th) so I decided I would wear and share about my projects:

And finally, I overtook my impostor syndrom (a bit ðŸ˜…) and decided I would open a patreon if anyones wants to support me regularly !

And this is it for this pretty long July thread !
