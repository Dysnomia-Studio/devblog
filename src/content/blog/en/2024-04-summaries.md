🧵 1/7 - Monthly summary #16, April 2024

Hi!

April has been a bit more productive on the projects side than the previous months even though I'm still working on my new house.

But here's a good view into great milestones in the month:

Another big milestone of the month, Alchemistry has its 5th major update released this month.
It was supposed to be released around March 7th for its 2nd anniversary but ... well, renovation ate my free time 😁

🧵 5/7

April has been the start of lots of WIP projects such as an automated wiki for my games, a C# rework of my personal assistant, and a public repo showing my usual game dev roadmap. I will talk about all of this in detail when they are available to the public!

However, I can share some #art:

I also did lots of small improvements and updates on my projects, but as a last item to this thread, I want to share my brand n8n automation which automatically watches social networks for posts about my games!
