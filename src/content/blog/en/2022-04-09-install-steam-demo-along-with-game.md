You can get your demo app ID using SteamWorks, or using [Steamdb](https://steamdb.info) using the search bar, in the results:

## Open steam console

To open steam console, type [steam://open/console](steam://open/console) in your browser adress bar

## Install game demo using command

Type `app_install DEMO_ID` while replacing *DEMO_ID* by your app id, for example `app_install 1766570`.

## Have fun!

You should now have both game and demo in your game library! (And it will update as a normal game)
