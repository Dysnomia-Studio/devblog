A bit late for my monthly summary time, but I didn't want to send 2 threads too close from each other (see below !).

During April, Alchemistry got a new major update adding new items and achievements: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1730540/view/3722830516541187226

<hr />

As said earlier, there also was a nice thread about Alchemistry figures and stats I posted a week ago: https://blog.dysnomia.studio/blog/en/2023-05-20-alchemistry-figures/

<hr />

Outside Alchemistry, I finally shared a new GIF about my new WIP #indie game !

I won't share a lot of details yet, but Steam page might be public soon :)

<hr />

About L.U.M.E.N. (my personal assistant), I did a lot of small updates because Desktop app have a lot of performance issues. I reduced impact but ... it's still not that good, still have work to do ! I'm thinking of maybe moving to Tauri instead of Electron as well.

<hr />

Dysnomia (my company) finally got a new and clean website last month as well !

<hr />

On the infra side, I did a lot of small updates, crashed my postgres server because I did stupid things with storage (but kubernetes cluster survived, yay !), and basically cleaned a lot of small issues. I also moved the last 2 websites from my old server. Oh, I have ipv6 now btw

<hr />

Some small news:
- I decided to abandon self-hosted postfix/dovecot for Proton mails
- I wrote a small story (in french) in the Galactae Universe: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbAEDQ51ddBt3Y2gMUDvG4gdQZCF4r4yInSdNIhwxP8/edit?usp=sharing
- I wrote a small discord bot to have server-stats: https://github.com/Elanis/discord-server-stats
- I closed 97/99 dependabot PRs

<hr />

And here we are for April !
