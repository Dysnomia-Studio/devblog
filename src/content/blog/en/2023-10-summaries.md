Hello !
Not late writing my monthly summary :o

October was a huge month for Extortion, I participated to Programmer's day sale and got impressive figures (beating launch day!)
See https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Elanis/111217403511029788 for figures and story ðŸ¤“

(Btw, simplified chinese translation incoming ðŸ‘€)

Extortion also got a quality of life update last month, just before these events. And more stuff coming soon including a whole rework of translation system because it's needed for simplified chinese community translations !

Last month, I also published my second Manufactur'inc devblog on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2146380/view/3737483611565199154
This time, we talk about automation, but behind the scenes

I was working on some developer stuff as well, namely my administrative client.
This tool will be used for me to create new contracts (=quests), tools, items and even more inside the game easily for next updates !
What does it look like ? Here's a glimpse of the first version:

Misc:
- As always, I keep up to date lots of techincal dependencies. I'm not always mentionning it, but I spend few hours across the month on it. Also, I get a nice rythm with Dependabot 163/168 closed PR
- Sometimes, I also get some infrastructure issues, so I'm a firefighter once a while

And here we are for October !
