ðŸ§µ 1/7 - Monthly summary #27, March 2025

Welcome back to my monthly thread were I share some of the behind the scenes of my projects!
Differents months are now common since I'm back to experimenting and testing lots of stuff.
This month: Personal Assistant, Teaching, and even some #godot!

ðŸ§µ 2/7
Like last month, I focused lots of my time on rewriting my personal assistant (L-U-M-E-N) in C#, it's been pretty cool to feel productive again. I've been rewriting the data mining modules for Steam partner's back-end (wishlists and sales), and even a tampermonkey script to automate everything

I also rewrote my Youtube watchlist datamining module, and eventually wrote a new module to get data from GoodReads RSS feeds, so I can get stats about what I read!

You can find this and everything else here on Github: https://github.com/L-U-M-E-N

ðŸ§µ 4/7

Like February, I'm also spending an important slice of my time preparing and teaching students in my old uni. I always love explaining them about serious stuff ... and less serious stuff such as IPoAC (Google it, you'll love it).

ðŸ§µ 5/7

As you may know, I'm used to doing game dev using web technologies such as React or Tauri. But in March, I had time and motivation to try playing with Godot Engine. I only did the 2D tutorial and some additional features, but I enjoyed it. Maybe there's some future for Godot in my tech stack!

ðŸ§µ 6/7

In March, I also updated my profile picture everywhere and reworked my banner as well.
I've been trying out a profile picture very close to this one for a month or two on Discord, and since I liked it, I started to switch everywhere :)

ðŸ§µ 7/7

That's already the end of my thread, if you want to follow my developer journey, you can follow this account, join us on Discord at https://discord.gg/c8aARey, and wishlist my games on Steam (see my profile description), this means a lot to me :)

Thanks for reading!
