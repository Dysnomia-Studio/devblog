ðŸ§µ 1/8 - Monthly summary #26, February 2025

February has been a special month. Once I was done with the Manufactur'inc demo update, I went into very different activities than usual: back to teaching, contributing to Wikipedia, and reworking my personal assistant in C#.

Let's dip into all of this!

Last month, the Manufactur'inc demo update, which included some quality-of-life improvements and fixes for the Linux version, was released.

I'm still searching for the best way to work on Manufactur'inc demo in the future, I'll keep yall updated!

The biggest activity of the month was about reworking my personal assistant in C#. The existing version was written in JS in the last 8-9 years and it definitely needed some overhaul.

To prepare this rework, I added some additional methods to my Steam Library to be able to query steam sold copies and wishlists from the steam partner backend: https://github.com/Dysnomia-Studio/Dysnomia.Common.SteamWebAPI/releases/tag/1.7.0

And I reworked my first full module in the end of the month: https://github.com/L-U-M-E-N/Lumen.Modules.Youtube

I now have this module in production to test my datamining system and improve it so I can rewrite and deploy the next modules soon :)

I'm also back to teaching the 3rd year students from the uni where I had my master's degree, I love teaching, it's always fun to share with them about cool technical stuff and April fools RFCs !

And finally, it's been a few months since I started to actively contribute to the French Wikipedia and to Wikidata. It's pretty cool to see how it works behind the scenes, and I'm happy to improve video game and cinema-related articles :)
