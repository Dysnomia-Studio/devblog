Good afternoon !

Time is flying, it's already time for the monthly summary ! I was at Gamescom in august so it will be shorter than usual.

Last month, I announced my next game: Manufactur'inc: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2146380/Manufactur_inc/

This is a multiplayer factory & company management game where you will blueprint, optimize the production of course, but also where you would have to take decisions to influence your worker conditions, ecological impact, automation level, and even more !

To prepare some of these screenshots, I had to do more front-end work that I expected. I especially worked on some generic components to help build UI. I am happy of what I have been able to build within few evenings:

Another project had User Interface and User eXperience improvements, that's my translation tool.
I made the tool easier to use for this new game to add items, categories, and of course to localize terms !

Smaller projects had updates as well:
- My Discord stats bot had some fixes and improvements (especially around threads and a /serverinfo command): https://github.com/Elanis/discord-server-stats
- I wrote a Javascript script to cleanup my org packages history because it weight a lot after 6+ months ðŸ˜… https://gist.github.com/Elanis/cedb3d5cb9025b28e60302f7dbeec29b
- I closed 88/91 Dependabot PR this month
- And I finally was able to integrate my old server to the kubernetes cluster ðŸŽ‰
