Hi!
Back to the monthly summary, today we have: automation, improvements, pictures, and a new game!

🧵 2/10

As shared yesterday (and in this first post!), I started working on a new train management game. It's been an idea for a while but I lacked motivation before. 

But now I'm back in the happy-gamedev mood for the best 😁

🧵 3/10

This new project helped me to improve and bugfix my 2D rendering React lib. Two updates have been pushed yesterday: https://github.com/Dysnomia-Studio/canvas2d-wrapper

A new shape, the minimap feature, and lots of new things are here!

Still on the gamedev side, despite the project being kinda paused. I experimented with AssemblyScript to try compiling the Manufactur'inc simulation into a wasm binary.

Very difficult, it does sound like it won't be the way to go!

🧵 5/10

Automation-wise, LUMEN saw a new module migration: https://github.com/L-U-M-E-N/Lumen.Modules.Notabot

Also, I automated some SonarQube branch cleanup using n8n:

Also, lots of movements in the infrastructure. The first half of May saw some (internal) software updates and in the second half 2 incidents inside my providers' DC. Fortunately, the Kube cluster survived both incidents!

In May, I upgraded one of my hobbies by (finally) buying a camera:

Last but not least, a cool milestone for May with one of my gamedev TikTok posts reaching 10k views!
