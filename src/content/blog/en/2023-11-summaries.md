Hello!

Here we are again for a monthly summary. 11th one already!
This month was a bit of a chill and focused month: I worked extensively on the new Manufactur'inc resource simulation. A DevBlog dedicated to this is coming soon!

Speaking of Manufactur'inc, I also improved its administration client:

My web-to-app benchmark had multiple improvements including tables about WebGL support, frontend libraries, and even some clarifications brought by the Wails developer themself!
Also great milestone, it reached 1000 stars two days ago üòç

I also worked a bit on some of my Grafana panels. I removed legacy panels and added a country map to show where my games have been sold (this is so cool to watch, I can't believe it sold in so many places!).

It was short, but here we are for November!
