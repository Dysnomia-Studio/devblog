🧵 1/14 - Monthly summary #34, October 2025

Good morning! October has been a "small month" with 35h spent on my projects... And yet, lots of things to talk about. This month: Extortion 5th anniversary, some fun bug, the community is lovely, and of course, you know me, STATS!

Let's start with the big event of the month. Extortion was released 5 years ago, and to celebrate this, I released an update earlier in October and had the lowest discount yet:

While posting this news, I had the loveliest reply... This is definitely why I love doing gamedev too! ♥

After this update, the community played and found some (old and new) bugs, and improved the Simplified Chinese version. So I had to release a second update 😁

5 years since my game released, that also gives a good reason to give *another bunch of stats*™, so of course I did it:

Steam announced they created a landing page for every Steam Deck-verified game, so I had one for Alchemistry: https://store.steampowered.com/verified/1730540/Alchemistry
Alchemistry has been Steam Deck verified for a few years now, but it's still really cool to see my small game with this checkmark 😁

Still in gamedev, Logistik has now been announced for more than a month, and I'm glad to say it already reached 70 wishlists 💕
That's around 1% towards the release objective, but that's already some milestone, so thanks ♥

Working on the game also means having fun. So to test the tools, I tried doing #inktober with the game map ... And I abandoned after the first one, but it was fun ahah

Gamedev-adjacent, I updated my custom gamedev (web) library to be written in Typescript and run with Vite instead of react-script. That took me a few hours, but I'm pretty happy with the result: https://github.com/Dysnomia-Studio/canvas2d-wrapper/releases/tag/2.0.0

🧵 10/14

We love stats, right? So in October, I tried showing 5 years of sleep as a graph. And it looked *great* (thread): https://bsky.app/profile/elanis.eu/post/3m3ub7edxrs2q

🧵 11/14

Still in stats, I had a very fun bug on Grafana during the month, too. I have a graph to show the house electricity consumption, sorted into 3 categories: Bureau (my office), my car, and others. And I had a slight error in my calculus.

*250 kwh in a day is pretty high, huh ?*

🧵 12/14

Finally, one word about spam. During October, I had my bug tracker being spammed for days by some crawler (probably AI-related) bot, and when I say spam, that was enough to slow down that poor Ruby web server. So I had to spend time on rate-limiting stuff to stop bots...
