Hello there !

It's already mid-october and I almost forgot to write September summary :o

Last month, I published my first Manufactur'inc devblog on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2146380/view/7184986051960660929
And as I write these lines, I'm already preparing the second one !

<hr />

Manufactur'inc was my main focus of september, I updated the game Logo (images are before/after) and even made a tee-shirt of it !
I'm really happy of the result I've been able to get eventually :)

<hr />

Another great milestone for Manufactur'inc was both IGDB (https://www.igdb.com/games/manufacturinc) and Twitch category (https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/manufacturinc) pages for the game !
Also, I wrote a blog article about how to do this: https://blog.dysnomia.studio/blog/en/2023-09-10-add-your-game-to-twitch/

<hr />

Switching subject, I also updated my Personal Assistant to add a feature I was long wanting: automatically extracting images from music files !
There are still performance issues when showing huge music libraries (I have 235 albums), but overall, it's very cool to have :)

In the small subjects:
- I closed 124/125 dependabot PRs this month ! (But still have 3 from previous months, because it needs some work on infra)
- I tried to write a bot to grant Discord roles based on Steam games, but we can't get connected accounts (and linked roles doesn't have the feature yet)

<hr />

And here we are for September !
