ðŸ§µ 1/9 - Monthly summary #33, September 2025

Good afternoon!

Here we are for another monthly summary, this month: A new game, Silksong breaking my leaderboard, stats as usual, and more!

Of course, the big event of the month, one that took me more than half of my project's time in September, was the announcement of my new game: 

Logistik, a game where you lay tracks, schedule trains, and optimize routes to transport passengers and cargo across the map!

ðŸ§µ 3/9

Preparing this announcement, I tried putting some stuff again on TikTok and YouTube shorts, trying to bring visibility to my games. It wasn't *that bad* on the viewcount side, but on Steam, the impact was close to 0.

Still in the gamedev field, I had to do some fun announcement last month: my game leaderboard was broken because ... Silksong release went so hard it crashed Steam APIs ðŸ˜‚  Not on my 2025 bingo card!

ðŸ§µ 5/9

A few minor updates on my personal assistant and my rendering library (canvas2d-wrapper) were released, but more on that in the October summary! ðŸ‘€

Not a lot of occasions to use my camera recently, but during September I tried taking some pics of the moon... Here they are:

Along with the Logistik announcement, I did a - very rare - everyone on my Discord server, sharing news about all my games at once!

Finally, the funny stats guy is still there, I had a new car, an EV... So *OF COURSE*, I had to start writing a Grafana dashboard. (Automatic data mining not yet there, but soon!)

That's already the end of my thread. If you want to follow my developer journey, you can also join us on Discord at https://discord.gg/c8aARey, and wishlist my games on Steam (see my profile description). This means a lot to me :)

Thanks for reading!
