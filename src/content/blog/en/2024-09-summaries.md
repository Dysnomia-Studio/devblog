🧵 1/9 - Monthly summary #21, September 2024

October is very busy so I couldn't write this summary earlier...
September was busy as well! Since I finally moved, I was able to go back to full speed on my projects and do lots of things I had wanted to do since January

Let's talk about this 😎 #solodev

I'm back in the game dev world and made many improvements on Manufactur'inc. Let's highlight some with pictures:
- A right-click menu and lots of improvements and new features on the factory view
- New sounds and music
- As a settings panel
- Leaderboards
- Lots of QoL
- ...

Aside from the game itself, I also worked on new cool things such as the official game roadmap as well as a brand new long description for the game.

🧵 4/9

Some of you probably saw it, I also made some "IMG-to-Factory" software for the fun to be able to convert about any image to a factory layout.
Technical fun all the way 😁

🧵 5/9

For the French-speaking lads, I also did some kind of conference on the French programming-related Discord server Not a Name, about "what's like to be an indie dev ?"

🧵 6/9

I've been working on making my homelab minimalist and started running some stuff on a solo raspberry pi instead of my old PC (Went from 90W to 5W-ish !).
(I've done other stuff with Raspberry Pi in October as well, but it's a story for next month's summary 👀)

🧵 7/9

I've also started to be pretty active on some new social media:
- Back on Twitch every week: https://www.twitch.tv/elanis42
- Experimenting on Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@elanis42
- And of course, I'm a lot more active on Bluesky since I feel I now have a new community here ❤️

Finally, what does my computer look like when I try to work on a 10039x24331 pixels Photoshop project?
Like that:
