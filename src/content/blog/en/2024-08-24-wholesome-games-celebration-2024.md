A week ago, I participated in the Wholesome Games Celebration on Steam with Alchemistry, which was huge for me in terms of numbers!

[Alchemistry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730540/Alchemistry/) is a game inspired by Little Alchemy. It was created for HonestDan's GameJam 2 years ago, which became the game demo—and evolved into a full-fledged game eventually!

It was my second game on Steam, after Extortion.

Like Extortion, this game was mainly for fun, and to learn about the Steam platform. The hidden goal was to have an okay hourly rate (which eventually succeeded recently!). It also had some updates along the way, the latest major one being 4 months ago.

Fast-forward to the Wholesome Games Celebration, their daily deal plus the variety of game size probably helped a lot of developers, that's pretty cool!
Now, the juicy stats you've been waiting for:

I want to thank [@_wholesomegames](https://wholesomegames.com/) for their event. They definitely gave me a lot of visibility, and to lots of great games as well!
