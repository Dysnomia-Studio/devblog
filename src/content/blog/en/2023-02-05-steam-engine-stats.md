We were on @SirLynix twitch stream wondering what were the market shares for different game engines. So, I had to make STATS !

Profile feature limited means the game doesn't have enough review/copies sold. It's a nice way to separate "very small" games and others.

All time:

I'm using @SteamDB Instant search (https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/) figures for these graphs. Thanks to them !
And here's my Google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uSKGUcgLPXCpt1TFmJhDiPw08wVV9N5IBJISnClV5PU/edit?usp=sharing
