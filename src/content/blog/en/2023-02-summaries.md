We are back with a monthly summary ! Here's what I've done during February:

Extortion got an update, it adds a new settings to chose font size as well as other QoL improvements: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1299430/view/3651892391831335507

I did organize the second edition of #NotAGameJam this month ! We had a dozen of people participating and 7 games submitted, see it here: https://itch.io/jam/not-a-gamejam-2

I did participate but haven't been able to finish my game ...
