ðŸ§µ 1/12 - Monthly summary #32, August 2025

Good Evening! Lazy September after a busy August, I've been procrastinating before writing this looooonng summary ðŸ˜…

This month: personal assistant, QoL for my gamedev life, creativity, and more!

ðŸ§µ 2/12

During august, I had two weeks off from my freelance work, so I've been able to do lots of things I wanted to do for a while, and while I had a daily summary here: https://bsky.app/profile/elanis.eu/post/3lxqxjt72zs2l let's talk about the important stuff!

<hr />

ðŸ§µ 3/12

Probably the most important thing was my new gamedev stack, so I have some updated libs, hot reload, and steam api support directly in the dev. environment and lots of new things! It has already been applied (in beta) to all my games and will be deployed soon.

Manufactur'inc demo already benefited from this in an update fixing lots of issues on Linux and MacOS: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2146380/view/499456360206828166

Also, since I needed it, I also pushed some PR on greenheartgames' greenworks (JS Steamworks lib) to improve the authentication support, you can see it here: https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks/pull/348

<hr />

ðŸ§µ 6/12

Speaking of open-source contributions, I'm proud to say I've had my first PR merged in .NET! ðŸŽ‰
That was a bug that was messing with my monitoring infrastructure, so it's going to be fixed in .NET 10 :)

ðŸ§µ 7/12

Far from gamedev but close to .NET, my personal assistant saw some datamining-related updates with new modules for Enedis and GRDF (French natural gas and electricity networks) stats. And a brand new (and cool!) org. README: https://github.com/L-U-M-E-N

ðŸ§µ 8/12

Back to gamedev, I've been working on my design system and prepared a reusable menu for all my games, with a brand new feature: a carousel showing my other games :) It's going to be used in my new game (steam store page will be public soon, I promise!), here's a teaser:

ðŸ§µ 9/12

On another project, I also took some time to write that idea of a prequel/parallel story to my first Steam Game Extortion on a document. I don't know if it will lead to a real game or not, but maybe I'll reuse the custom engine in that game for a second one ? We'll see in the future!

Because in August I kept using my camera - a lot - a new Discord channel appeared dedicated to photography. Feel free to share your own pics as well here! I'd love to bring a bit more misc. activity there. As a reminder, it's here: https://discord.gg/c8aARey

ðŸ§µ 11/12

A fun bug I had to fix for achieve.games was about its database dump here: https://github.com/Dysnomia-Studio/achieve-games-dump 
There are so many Steam games that the Git commits started to be too big for GitHub APIs! Fortunately, it's been an easy fix ... I removed two useless fields in the object ðŸ˜‚

That's already the end of my thread. If you want to follow my developer journey, you can also join us on Discord at https://discord.gg/c8aARey, and wishlist my games on Steam (see my profile description). This means a lot to me :)

Thanks for reading!
