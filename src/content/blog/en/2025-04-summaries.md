ðŸ§µ 1/8 - Monthly summary #28, April 2025

Good morning peeps!

A bit late this month since I was having some holidays last weekend, but we're back for my monthly summary.
This month: automation, tools and some gamedev!

(Also, from now on, the summary pic excludes â‰¤ 5 minutes activities in the month)

ðŸ§µ 2/8

While working on an idea for a new game (more soon, if I like the MVP!), I started building a library to be used as a design system for my games. I realized Extortion, Alchemistry, and Manufactur'inc used similar React components, so why not try making a lib for that?

Another gamedev task in the month is to try to make the Steam Overlay work with Tauri apps. It's not easy because we have to hack by injecting some WGPU in the process, but we're trying to make it work with some Tauri community members.

Automation-wise, I keep trying to build some n8n workflow to automate some of my activities on social networks. I want to prepare stuff in advance and have it posted on multiple socials at once. It's not working yet, but I still have hopes!

ðŸ§µ 5/8

On the webdev topic, I was back working on my tool used for website analysis (HTTP headers, optimization, outdated stuff, ...). I re-wrote the whole project in C#, so now I can more easily make it evolve with a strongly typed (and faster) language than my JS POC.

ðŸ§µ 6/8

Still in April, but also in May, June, and July: I continue teaching at uni so it takes some parts of my free time. (But I definitely enjoy it!)

ðŸ§µ 7/8

Also, I took some time to test Jetbrains Fleet as an IDE last month. It's better than before in terms of performance/memory footprints, but for Rust and JS, I still prefer my Sublime Text setup.
I pushed my ST config on Github, btw!

That's already the end of my thread, if you want to follow my developer journey, you can follow this account, join us on Discord at https://discord.gg/c8aARey, and wishlist my games on Steam (see my profile description), this means a lot to me :)

Thanks for reading!
