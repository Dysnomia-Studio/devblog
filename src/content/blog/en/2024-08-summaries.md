ðŸ§µ 1/10 - Monthly summary #20, August 2024

A bit late but here I am! I finally moved and am back to my project full speed ahead ðŸš€

I had some time off work during late August so I was able to work on **lots** of things.

Let's start with my new office, and then talk about my #indiegame Manufactur'inc!

Manufactur'inc had some huge improvements during late August including:
- A sidebar rework to make it easier to use
- A new feedback form
- Some layout fixes on Steam Deck
- A new objective type for contracts (following a Steam game page!)
- A chalk texture applied to the blueprint view

And also:
- Some fixes for the production multi-server architecture
- More automated tests
- And much more during September (spoilers ðŸ‘€)

I also did some market studies on languages, tags, and prices.

August was a month for Alchemistry as well! It had a demo update and participated in the Wholesome Game Fest and it was unbelievably great in terms of results.

ðŸ§µ 6/10

Following the new Steam updates and rules, all my games received updated high-quality library assets, and some new long descriptions during late August/early September.

ðŸ§µ 7/10

As for more global news, I'm back to game development Twitch streaming (in French) at https://www.twitch.tv/elanis42 , and from December 2024, I will reduce my freelance time to 4 days a week to have more time dedicated to my games and other projects :)

ðŸ§µ 8/10

Still WIP, but my gamedev roadmap markdown file had some new entries as well: https://github.com/Dysnomia-Studio/gamedev-roadmap/blob/main/README.md

ðŸ§µ 9/10

There are still lots of things I could talk about, but this thread already starts to be pretty long!
September will be another big month, as well as October. And I'm genuinely so happy to be back to more side project dedicated time :p
