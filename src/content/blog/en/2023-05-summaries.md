Hello there !
Another month where I'm a bit late on schedule üòÅ
Let's talk about May !

Last month, I told about my new Discord stats bot. I improved it by adding some slash-commands as well !
Repo: https://github.com/Elanis/discord-server-stats

This month, I worked a bit with my React canvas library (https://github.com/Dysnomia-Studio/canvas2d-wrapper) to try out drawing some world map. It worked really well, and without any needed change in the lib code !

I also worked on improving my personal assistant performances (CPU and memory wise), and on some bugs especially one with timezone when using Proton Calendar, and one with my P110 (smart plugs) which were still bugged after my previous update.

Alchemistry figures I posted on Twitter and mastodon last month now are in a dedicated blog post as well: https://blog.dysnomia.studio/blog/en/2023-05-20-alchemistry-figures/

Finally, I did a lot of additional stuff including:
- Working on some Rust compat with new things in Steam dll (more info in the next summary !)
- Monitoring my servers using my Raspberry Pi at home
- Reducing some website sizes using webp/woff
- Closing 122/126 dependabot PR

And here we are for May !
