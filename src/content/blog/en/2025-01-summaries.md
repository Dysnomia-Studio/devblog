ðŸ§µ 1/7 - Monthly summary #25, January 2025

It's already my 25th monthly summary!
This month, I mainly had the sysops hat because I had to move to the new servers I took during Black Friday. But I finished with some Manufactur'inc fixes, let's talk about all of this!

ðŸ§µ 2/7

Firstly, I spent lots of time in January (and December!) working on improving my infra-as-code setup (Ansible, argocd, ...) and moving to my new cluster. Same power, half the monthly price! That's ~50h of work, but I now have everything setup without even the need to connect to the servers ðŸ˜Ž

ðŸ§µ 3/7

Along with these migrations, I reworked a bit some of my websites and apps so it has better performances (esp. one of them that was loading in-RAM the whole Steam app list ðŸ™ˆ), still some work to do, but it's on the right path!

ðŸ§µ 4/7

As told in the intro, I am BACK working on Manufactur'inc in late January, I finished moving to Tauri version 2 and fixed some issues on Linux systems, and it's now in production, you can take a look at the changelog here (still some work to do!): https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2146380/view/528711370531669092

ðŸ§µ 5/7

Some additional behind-the-scenes work: I finally have been able to switch from Create-React-App to Vite on both Extortion and Alchemistry, these updates aren't published yet, but it'll be embed in the next major update for each game :)

ðŸ§µ 6/7

Also, not clearly january-y, but I also started to take some time to write down my ideas for every major project bouncing in my head for some time. I hope to dedicate some time to them soon too, once I cleared the remaining important stuff! That should be okay since I now have my friday to work on the projects
