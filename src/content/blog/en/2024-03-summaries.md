March's monthly summary will be even shorter than February's one. Between renovating my home and my two weeks in San Francisco for #GDC2024, that was somehow difficult to progress on my projects.

A little teasing: I started working on a new major update for Alchemistry and will release it soon!

About Manufactur'inc, I've spent some time trying to gauge languages used for similar games.
It confirms I should try to localize it in English, French, German, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.
(This is not  a promise, but a wish because it'll be expensive for sure!)

I cannot talk of March without talking about GDC. I posted a few pictures here a few weeks ago, take a look!

To finish the month, I've been reorganizing my games' Discord server. There was too much public channel and it looked dead as hell. I merged most English and French channels as one single channel and will be creating language-specific ones in the future if needed.
