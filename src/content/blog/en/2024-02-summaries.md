ðŸ§µ 1/6 - Monthly summary #14, February 2024

Still about Manufactur'inc, two nice figures: we reached 300 wishlists in February, and I reached 100 hours on Steam!

And we're done! If you're curious about my projects, you can take a look at my Github https://github.com/Elanis/ , follow this account, or even join my project's discord server: https://discord.gg/c8aARey

Have a good week-end!
