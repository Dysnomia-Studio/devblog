🧵 1/6 - Monthly summary #17, May 2024

Good morning Internet!

House renovation is almost at the decoration point, I see my free time being available again soon 😁

In between my painting evening, I've been working on a brand new Wiki for my games:

#gamedev #screenshotsaturday #indie #indiedev

🧵 2/6

This wiki is using https://astro.build/ and is open source: https://github.com/Dysnomia-Studio/dysnomia-wiki/.

Why create this?
Because I wanted an auto-generated wiki based on my game code, assets, and a few react templates :)

There will be a full dedicated DevBlog about this next week (follow me so you won't miss it ;) )

🧵 3/6

To feed this wiki and to continue working on Manufactur'inc MVP, I've been improving the administration system which inserts the game content in the backend.

I also spent some time playing like ... a player (surprising, huh !) to find what was missing in the game. I'm heading to an MVP during the summer (more info soon 👀).

🧵 5/6

My web-to-desktop framework comparison also made some improvements during May. The community is involved in giving some nice ideas (and PRs too!) and we worked together to improve what's shown and measured: https://github.com/Elanis/web-to-desktop-framework-comparison

This is still WIP tho!

And we're done! If you're curious about my projects, you can take a look at my Github https://github.com/Elanis/ , follow this account, or even join my project's discord server: https://discord.gg/c8aARey

Have a good weekend!
