ðŸ§µ 1/11 - Monthly summary #35, July 2025

Gooooood morning Bluesky! (Yeah, it's evening here, but who cares?)

Here we are for another, a busy, monthly summary!

This month: wiki, devblog, bugfixes, stats, and a lot more!

Let's start with the wiki!
After some questions from a community member on my game "Extortion", I decided it was finally time to create a semi-automated wiki page like for both other games, so here we are: https://wiki.dysnomia.studio/extortion/achievements

<hr />

In the same vibe, using astro.build, I rewrote my whole devblog so it's easier to maintain. You can even find the history of this very monthly summary there: https://blog.dysnomia.studio/monthly-summary

Stats-wise, I've been productive in July, you can find a post about how the festival affects my revenues (sadly, fewer festivals for me this year!): https://bsky.app/profile/elanis.eu/post/3lsy4uix2f22s as well as some per-country (territories actually) stats: https://bsky.app/profile/elanis.eu/post/3lu2ryvke422n

Still on stats, a funny moment in July was when the Steam backend went completely crazy and we could almost think my game had some audience! (self-deprecation here, don't worry, I'm so happy there are already so many players.)

But with the real figures, hey, it's not that bad, the Steam Summer Sale is nice to have!

Manufactur'inc demo had an - urgent - bugfix applied during the month. That's what's happening when you update some dependencies and don't test everything!
(More updates soon to fix most known bugs!)

Last month also saw some welcome updates on LUMEN Modules dependencies: https://github.com/orgs/L-U-M-E-N/
And I even imported manually (still need to work on the module), my Google Fit (steps) data:

On various news, Extortion will soon have a new update for its 5th anniversary, and next week it's taking part in the "Back to School Games Celebration", feel free to wishlist the game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299430/Extortion/

And finally, I'm working on lots of other things during August, won't spoil anything, but you can get a taste of what I'm doing by following my account and reading my daily vacation summary, see today's one here: https://bsky.app/profile/elanis.eu/post/3lwleb6xf6k2k

<hr />

ðŸ§µ 11/11

That's already the end of my thread. If you want to follow my developer journey, you can also join us on Discord at https://discord.gg/c8aARey, and wishlist my games on Steam (see my profile description). This means a lot to me :)

Thanks for reading!
