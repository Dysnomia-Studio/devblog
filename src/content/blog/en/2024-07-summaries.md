ðŸ§µ 1/5 - Monthly summary #19, July 2024

Hi!

Did I almost forget to write July's summary? Yep!

July was pretty light, and August is the opposite (you'll probably see August summary and some other posts in the following weeks ðŸ‘€)
It was the month to see the Manufactur'inc automated wiki come to life!

I also reworked achieve.games Discord bot to have it less error-prone and most importantly, being able to be installed on the user profile.
Which made me able to use it in DM and some other servers :)

More Grafana stuff, as usual?
I've been working on a new panel for my house energy consumption, and revamped my Steam summary panel as well :)
