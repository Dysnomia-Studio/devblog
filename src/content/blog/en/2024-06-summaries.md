ðŸ§µ 1/5 - Monthly summary #18, June 2024

Hi!

Am I writing this summary on the first day of the month for the first time in a while? YES!

June has been about refactoring and automation such as my new and shiny CI who automatically test Manufactur'inc!

There have been tons of similar improvements during the month. Why doing this?
Because during June I have been teaching as usual, but they were in the middle of their project and needed help once in a while, so I try occupying my time while being available immediately, so no big feature here!

One cool thing I have been able to set up on one of my Sundays was a new automation on N8N (a workflow automation tool) to automatically clean old artifacts from GitHub Packages. Pretty cool, right?

I also have been working on improving my automated wiki (see last month's thread!) but nothing to show, it's more about compressing pictures, and enhancing SEO, ... But I plan to write a DevBlog about all of this soon! (When I have some free time ...)
