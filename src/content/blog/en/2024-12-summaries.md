🧵 1/5 - Monthly summary #24, December 2024

Good evening!
December was another month of different topics, so let's take a look at what I was able to do!

Let's start with a new view into my month's activity:

During December, I did lots of behind-the-scenes work: migrating websites to .NET 9, migrating my apps to Tauri V2, adding typscript compatibility to my javascript canvas lib, ...
I was following the flow to what inspired me 😁

🧵 4/5

On the socials side, I reached 2k followers in early December here, and removed the last Twitter links from my websites/online profiles. My handle here has also been updated to use my domain name 😎

There's also tons of WIP in multiple projects ... but I'll talk about it later :p
That's already the end of my thread, if you want to follow my #indiedev journey, you can follow this account, join us on Discord at https://discord.gg/c8aARey, and wishlist my games on Steam, this means a lot to me :)
