ðŸ§µ 1/4 - Monthly summary #22, October 2024

October has been busy and anxiety-producing, I've been participating in my first IRL convention, and released Manufactur'inc Demo on Steam, then went for Next Fest.

It was something, I learned a lot, and I talked about it in Manufactur'inc Devblog: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2146380/view/4529024222460953609

<hr />

ðŸ§µ 2/4 - I won't write the usual summary this month because ... I'm thinking a lot, I don't know exactly what the future of Manufactur'inc will be.

<hr />

ðŸ§µ 3/4 - I had lots of feedback, and it makes me wonder if it's worth it to develop and work on a live-service/multiplayer game, even though I'm sure it can be amazing for players, I'm not sure it will be good for my health long term

<hr />

ðŸ§µ 4/4 - So, very short, late, and kinda depressing this month, but for the better :) You'll get updates when I finally decide, on Mastodon(@Elanis@mastodon.gamedev.place), on Bluesky(@elanis.eu), and on Discord (https://discord.com/invite/c8aARey). Thank you for your support â™¥
