6. **04/2024 - #6 - How to balance and create content behind the scenes?**  (Here !)

Hello, fellow future entrepreneurs!

As I explained on multiple occasions [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/c8aARey), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/elanis.eu), and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Elanis), I am currently renovating my house and participated to GDC, thus why I skipped March for a DevBlog and slowed down development during these months.   
But here I am, back with a brand new Devblog! I will still work less than usual during the end of April and early May, but we will see my free time returning to a normal state during late spring and summer!  
Working on this game in my free time is surely an unstable situation, but fortunately, I enjoy it a lot! :)  
  
Let's get back to this DevBlog subject now: Today, I will talk about an administrative tool I've been building for a few months now, which will help me to build the game, especially when creating new content updates during the early access phase and afterward!

**Why build this tool?**

You could wonder why I would need to build this tool since there are probably existing ones on the market or I could work without it.
And this is a good question actually.

I am building this tool for multiple reasons:
1. This is a game-specific tool so I can't find something similar on the internet
2. I like to automate and simplify lots of processes, the goal being to have a smooth and easy experience while creating content for my projects. I wanted to ditch the "boring stuff" and focus on creating more in an equivalent timespan.
3. I wanted a tool that helped me to see the existing stuff (items, equipment, recipes, contracts,...) so I don't create duplicate elements, can keep them coherent, and balance them without many issues.

So, this is why I created this tool! (WIP)

As you can see, it's not as pretty as the game interface, but we don't really care since the only user will probably be me. I will focus on some good user experience, such as this:

It is in active development along with another tool that can apply balancing to the game server live, and the game itself of course.

And for those who have followed me for a longer time, you know it's not the only tool I've been creating for my games, since I also built a translation tool for my oldest games a few years ago

This is of course a time investment, but it helps me add new items/equipment metadata in a matter of minutes.  
What's left afterward when adding this kind of stuff are the graphics ... and this is a whole other topic.  
  
Using these tools, I will be able to focus on writing new features, improve the User Experience, and just improve the game itself.  
If you're curious about other things I use to improve my productivity on Manufactur'inc and my previous games, I suggest you read about [Manufactur'inc 2nd DevBlog about automation](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2146380/view/3737483611565199154).  
  
If you liked this DevBlog, you can **read the other ones** and **share them with your friends**.  
  
And one way to not miss the following ones is to follow the game Hub, using the "Follow" button on the Steam page.  
And if you're interested, I would also be happy if you wishlisted the game as well.
