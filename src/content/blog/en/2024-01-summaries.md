🧵 1/9 - Monthly summary #13, January 2024

Hello there!

I have lots of things to show about Manufactur'inc (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2146380/Manufactur_inc/) in January!

One great image of the month is this picture of the game running fine on my Steam Deck with the PTB server console in the background!

There have been a lot of various improvements when it comes to User Interface and User Experience, and I added a brand new context menu on the factory view.
I also added (early Feb) some new buildings to test more stuff.

Speaking of UX, it's been running smoothly at 60fps on my computer without any major CPU or GPU load 😍

A little behind the scenes is the improvement of my administration panel. It works really well now to manage the game items and types of equipment. And soon, contracts as well!

In mid-January, I was taking part in Steam Capitalism and Economy Fest, it had some great results and helped me reach 300 wishlists on the game! I'm happy the game gains more and more attractivity.
Here are the stats since the public announcement:

Speaking of Steam figures and stats, I've been reworking LUMEN's steam module to get more accurate data and also being able to store Steam Followers.
I also reworked the grafana panel and I feel it looks great now!

Another grafana panel rework was the Youtube watchlist stats one. I wanted all the informations on a single screen, and I think I succeed to get a good result.

I also did a lot of other things including you can find on my Github ( https://github.com/Elanis/ ), or this account, or even join the Discord ( https://discord.gg/c8aARey ) to see all of this and the future ones!

Oh and while working on Manufactur'inc admin, I found how to become rich!
